# About:

I had no desire to install all software locally, so I decided to use containers and Docker.

## Why:

- get a more recent and stable version
- ability to use multiple versions simultaneously
- can easily migrate to new hardware without losing data
- at any time, we can reconfigure the software for myself
- easily and quickly raise the developer's environment
- do not clog the system

## Corrections:

I raised this repository for myself, but you can also easily use it for your purposes.

Most importantly, replace the path and adjust the settings for yourself.

## Attention:

I use this repository and setup for the sole purpose of research, development ON on my device and only for research purposes.

For use in 'production', you need to take care of safety!
